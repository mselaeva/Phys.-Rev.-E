# Phys.-Rev.-E
codes for Predictability of extreme events in a chain of coupled Kuramoto oscillators

Dear Editor,

Our previous research published in Phys. Rev. E was done in 2023, therefore the new requirement to share our codes for the review purposes comes unexpected. After exporting a figure, we partly modify the simple Matlab code for the aims of the next study and the next figure. Unfortunately, we did not save each version separately considering the code as an unimportant technical tool to check mathematical formulas and make illustrations. To help the review process we did our best providing comments within the code. However, it is not possible to run the code as it is and to get a figure without filling the right parameters and commenting\uncommenting some lines. Parameters are provided in the caption of each figure in the manuscript. We are sorry for the inconvenience.
